# Decontextualizer

As a second step in improving our content consumption workflows, I investigated a new approach to extracting fragments from a content item before saving them for subsequent surfacing. While the [lexiscore](https://paulbricman.com/thoughtware/lexiscore) deals with content items on a holistic level -- evaluating entire books, articles, and papers -- I speculated then that going granular is a natural next step in building tools which help us locate *specific* valuable ideas in long-form content. The decontextualizer is a stepping stone in that direction, consisting of a pipeline for making text excerpts compact and semantically self-contained. Concretely, the decontextualizer is a web app able to take in an annotated PDF and automatically tweak the highlighted excerpts so that they make more sense on their own, even out of context.
